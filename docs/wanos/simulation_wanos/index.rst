The user-friendly DFT-VASP **WaNo** tool which enables you to easily perform Density Functional Theory calculations using the VASP code without extensive knowledge of VASP's functionalities and specifications.
  tool offers a variety of methods and only requires the POSCAR file as mandatory input, with all other VASP input 
  files generated or loaded automatically. The common outputs include the OUTCAR, CONTCAR, CHGCAR, and POTCAR files 
  and a lightweight, human-readable database in the `yml` extension, named vasp_results containing key information 
  about the simulation. Have fun!

  Let's start exploring your materials' properties with ease and precision! Welcome to the DFT-QE **WaNo**, which 
  performs DFT calculations using the powerful and flexible Quantum Espresso code! Quantum Espresso is an 
  open-source software package that can handle many systems, from small molecules to extended solids. It provides 
  a wide range of exchange-correlation functionals. It can be used to perform various types of calculations, including 
  ground state properties, electronic structure, and phonon calculations. With our **WaNo**, the pseudopotentials `[SSSP Efficiency (version 1.1.2)] <https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency>`_
  are automatically identified based on the chemical species specification. All input files are generated or loaded automatically 
  after reading the geometry file in `.cif` format, making it easy for you to start.
