  Keeping track of your data got much easier with the DB-Generator **WaNo**. It is perfect for organizing your data and making 
  it easy to find what you need. It generates a lightweight, human-readable database in `.yml` format for all **WaNos** of a 
  given workflow, providing an easy way to access key information about your simulations. Say goodbye to cluttered and 
  disorganized folders and hello to streamlined and organized data. Give it a try and see how it simplifies your 
  workflow and makes your data more accessible.


* Format-Converter (:download:`github <https://github.com/KIT-Workflows/Format-Converter>`)

Using ASE technology, this **WaNo** easily converts a geometry file from format **A** to format **B**. Even better, it cleverly solves the problem of missing unit cell information in 'xyz' files by generating a cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter 25% larger than the maximum distance between atoms, making adding a unit cell to 'xyz' files a breeze.
